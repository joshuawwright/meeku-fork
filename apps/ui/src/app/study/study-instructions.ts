export const STUDY_INSTRUCTIONS = `Throughout this experiment, you will be presented with two sets of letter sequences, one at the top portion of
    the screen and one in the middle portion of the screen. You will also be presented with some response option
    buttons along the bottom of the screen. These buttons may denote the relationship between the letter sequences.
    They may or may not be familiar to you. Your task is to select the response option that accurately represents the
    relationship between the letter sequences. You can make your selection by touching the screen or clicking on the
    relevant response option at the bottom of the screen.\n
    Your participation has to be done in one sitting. Typically, participation takes approximately 90 minutes or more to
    complete. To successfully complete, it is recommended that you minimize sources of distraction while
    participating. This includes being in a quiet space away from other devices and putting this device on “Do not
    disturb” mode or its equivalent.\n
    Successful completion may be challenging and confusing. Please persist to the end and give it your best effort.
    During some portions of the experiment you will be provided feedback on your selections. If you don’t see
    feedback, please continue making selections. There is a time limit for making your selections. Please choose your
    response as fast as you can while still being accurate. Your compensation will go up the more accurate you are.\n
    This experiment will restart if it is no longer the active window. In order to complete quickly, please do not open 
    other tabs or software while doing this task.`;
